Project of Dice Game from Class INST 126\
Rules of the Game
The game can have one or more players.
Players take turns rolling three dice.
If all three dice show the same number, the player scores zero points for that turn.
If two dice show the same number, they are "fixed" and cannot be rerolled.
Players can reroll any dice that are not fixed until they decide to stop or "tupled out" (get three of the same number).
When a player decides to stop, they score points equal to the total of the three dice, and their turn ends.
