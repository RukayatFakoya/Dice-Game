# Dice-Game
Project of Dice Game from Class INST 126        
Rules of the Game        
The game can have one or more players.        
Players take turns rolling three dice.        
If all three dice show the same number, the player scores zero points for that turn.        
If two dice show the same number, they are "fixed" and cannot be rerolled.        
Players can reroll any dice that are not fixed until they decide to stop or "tupled out" (get three of the same number).        
When a player decides to stop, they score points equal to the total of the three dice, and their turn ends.        


Usage        
    Run the dice_game.py file.        
    Enter the number of players and the target score to win.        
    Follow the prompts to play the game.

    I would like to thank Gabby Ramirez for helping me look over my program, she pointed out the different issues I had and where she would change some sections. She also gave me some good insight on how I should stucture some of my code. This helped me while writing and figuring what I need to do next.
